Clean up this branch

Create new branch for the clean up <user>_D04_clean from this branch. The goal
is to have nice looking git history and each commit.

When merging two commits into one, take the commit message of the commit you're
merging into. For example merging A into B, use commit message of B.

Do NOT change commit messages in any way, except where it is told to add the
prefix. Each commit has to be clean - the changes made in it has to match the
commit message.


`git-split: fixup: Check parameter and print usage`
  should be merged into the
`git-split: Check parameter and print usage`
  to cover up my incompetence


`git-split: Check parameter and print usage`
  should be placed into
`Add initial version`


  Some patches are missing the prefix "git-split:", doesn't look nice in log, add it


`Revert "git-split: Add check if meld is installed"`
`git-split: Add check if meld is installed`
  remove those, no point in having patch and it's revert in history


`Add comments`
  Spread changes in this commit into others so it looks like we started commenting
  from the very beggining
